Latest runtime/test commit `013bf40db1d5b57c238ac3ac377e8ced98446fd1`, tree
`4f0d827bb26bba3ee8b20e21de891596fad0e98b`. Latest full suite: **89 desktop scripts
and 730 Lua syntax files, zero failures** in the [full report](validation/tier-count-full-2026-10-29.json).
All current Lua hashes must match that report before reusing its results.

## Era vendor evidence

The user's every-reopening hitch is reproduced on **Era 1.15.9.70576 / interface
11509**. One clean four-reopen pilot records a 333 ms maximum UI interval and
about 320 ms per restock target build, with automation off and scriptProfile=1.
It identifies unrelated live usability/tooltip checks in bag and cached personal-
bank tier counts. [PERF-006](TIER_COUNT_WORK.md) filters membership before the live
gate without adding caches/resources or changing quantities/UI timing.

Five alternating native background getter pairs return identical quantities.
Median inclusive CPU per five kinds: **bags 132.199 -> 15.237 ms**, **cached bank
118.897 -> 22.517 ms**. Native bank outputs are all zero; positive bank/warband
quantities have desktop coverage only. Raw samples, variation, hardware/addons,
settings and source-derived local probe are recorded. No public/native API replaced.
These results establish getter improvement, not whole-vendor after latency or FPS.

WoW stays in the background at the user's request; no further foreground access.
Original auto-sell/repair/restock flags are restored true; profiler preference
remains 1. Temporary sampler/namespaces cleared by reload and diagnostic exports
removed. The user's existing sync delivered candidate source; equality verified.
Latest recovery preserves on-disk WTF while both clients ran, not unsaved state.

Prior [vendor candidates](VENDOR_TIER_WORK.md), [junk availability](VENDOR_OPEN_WORK.md),
[stock reservations](VENDOR_STOCK_BUDGET.md) and [chat anchors](CHAT_QUICKJOIN_ANCHOR.md)
retain their separate source identities and scope. Reservations are not native
purchase acknowledgement; the chat native recheck remains pending.

## Editorial cleanup

Editor-specific plans, prompts/templates, original Word planning file, old handoffs,
local backup trees and sync log remain archived outside the addon. Working rules
live in [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) and [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md).
Earlier comment cleanup preserved executable Lua tokens/strings. Licenses,
third-party attribution, gameplay names and supported features remain intact.
Original requirements/raw records are preserved in [recovery](RECOVERY.md).

## Requirements and evidence

- [Feature inventory](FEATURE_INVENTORY.md): 1,384 parity rows covering all 26
  specifications, controls/defaults, commands, bindings, saved roots and integrations;
  17 discrepancies remain explicit.
- [Ownership map](MODULE_DEPENDENCIES.md): 35 domain/service rows and 24 API contracts.
  Load closure remains 577 reachable files with no missing includes.
- [Client validation](CLIENT_VALIDATION.md): eight distinct client rows and 77
  reference/version/license entries. Only Era gains partial native count evidence;
  original Wrath is distinct from modern Classic and remains unverified.
- [Performance protocol](PERFORMANCE_PROTOCOL.md): 242 result rows retain source
  identities, matched samples, limits and pending native acceptance.

## Pending work

Full foreground vendor after timing, matched screenshots/geometry/input, unprofiled
FPS, startup/cold work, native allocations/resource enumeration, combat/taint and
Retail secret-value checks remain pending. Background cadence cannot certify
foreground FPS. Preserve original profiling preferences when testing overhead.

When foreground testing is convenient, follow [exact vendor steps](TIER_COUNT_WORK.md).
Attribute any remaining hitch before another optimization. Other clients, external
provider readiness and native positive-bank/warband parity still need tests. Broader
service consolidation/lifecycle work remains unfinished. Event-dispatch mutation
is latent with no production unsubscribe trigger; avoid speculative redesign.

Auction, guild-bank and void-storage callback audits remain deferred by user
instruction. Continue in the existing folder/branch and leave main unchanged.
See [development tasks](DEVELOPMENT.md).

Final documentation validation passes: 763 classified sources, 577 reachable files,
361 setting definitions, 519 literal defaults, 23 SavedVariables roots and 12,824
local links. All six ledgers have valid shapes (1,384 parity, 35 ownership, 24 API,
eight client, 77 reference and 242 performance rows). All 730 normalized Lua hashes
match the full report. Checkpoint comparison preserves 361 specification/library/
asset/manifest/XML files byte-for-byte, with no missing files or unexpected changes.
Explicit development-tool markers remain absent across 1,244 actual files outside
Git. Main remains unchanged; complete native after acceptance remains pending.
